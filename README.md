## Miniaturized Compiler

This repo contains code required to run a mini compiler which can evaluate compositions of the following, basic expressions:

1) Arithmetic on floats/ints
2) Comparisons of floats/ints/bools
3) Concatenation of strings
4) Conditional implementation of any composition herein
5) Functional implementation of any composition herein
6) Recursive functional implementation of any composition herein

These capabilities can be evaluated (and, thus, compiled) in one of three ways:

1) Substitution semantics
2) Dynamic semantics
3) Lexical semantics

For more details on some of the features implemented for this compiler, please take a look at my writeup.pdf file.
